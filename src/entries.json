[{"uri":"/entries/01//commentary.txt","name":"01","commentary":"So I was thinking I'd like to do something meaningful.  What in the world\ncould that be?  Helping people seems to universally work as a way to find\nmeaning.  What can I help with?  \"Here's a website.  It will help you!\"  I\ndon't know.\n\nMaybe starting a blog or some type of resource to help people learn to code\nwould be cool.  There is no shortage of blogs or tech articles out there,\nthough.  What could I do differently?\n\nOne thing you don't see is complete honesty.  It may be unprofessional and\nmaybe severely undermine confidence, but what if someone showed you their\nmistakes?  Not as a gag reel or some sort of ironic thing, but more as a\ncandid view.  That may make things more approachable.  Mistakes are valuable\nbecause you get to learn from them, so sharing your mistakes seems like it\nwould increase the value.\n\nSo, the idea is not to be an unpolished slacker, but to provide complete\nopenness along with instruction.  To start with, a blog probably shouldn't be\na finished, beautiful product.  It's basically an open journal, right?\nPunctuation and grammar are fine, but it should probably be pretty rough and\nraw.\n\nSo here, what the heck.  Let's start with this.  I'm not sure where I'm going,\nwhat the point is, or how it will turn out, but this is my project.  From\ninception to completion as transparent as possible, I'm going to document it.\n\n...\n\nIn the interest of _somewhat_ tolerable writing, I need to pick an audience,\nthough.  I'm going to imagine...\n\nWell, I trailed off imagining myself at different points in my life when I was\nlearing to program.\n\nScrew it.  I'm just going to talk to the terminal.  If I start talking to \"the\naudience\" the tone will change and I'll start worrying too much about _how_\nI'm saying things rather than _what_ I'm saying.\n\n...\n\nOK, so what are the goals?\n\n1.  Transparency - I want mistakes to be visible, ignorance to be highlighted,\nand the documentation to be off the cuff.  This is to show that even\nsuccessful dudes who have been writing and studying code for many years and\nare pretty good at what they do are just regular guys full of doubt,\nignorance, and potential mistakes.\n\n2.  Create a Blog - The blog should be super easy to update (to encourage it\nhappen regularly), provide lots of detail, and have very \"raw\" content.\n\nI would like to get something up ASAP, so that it doesn't all appear at once\nat the end of the project.  Honestly, most (practically all) of my projects\ndie the day after I start them.  I get really pumped, start working, get\nsidetracked with infrastructure or find another cooler idea along the way...\nThere's always something, so the sooner I can get this \"launched\" the better\nchange it has of surviving past next week.\n\n\nWhat's the absolute fastest way to get an app out there into the world?  This\nis not a paid promotion, but I bet I can get this into the world in the next\n10 minutes with CRA and Heroku.\n\nHere's the plan.\n\n1.  create the app\n2.  post this as static content\n3.  deploy as a new free app in Heroku\n\n\n(Side note: It's going to become a pain in the ass documenting all of this\nstuff.  Maybe I could just log the terminal history or something.)\n\n```\ncreate-react-app site\n```\n\nI may elaborate on all this stuff later, but maybe not.  There are plenty of\nsources out there already.\n\nThis file is 01.txt in the dir above the `site` dir I just created.\n\n```\n/Users/jeremygreer/Ideas/blog/\n▼ site/\n  ► public/\n  ► src/\n    package.json\n    README.md\n    yarn.lock\n  01.txt\n```\n\nI'm sure I'll have resources _other_ than the site, but now I need to move the\ntext into the site.  What if I just symlink it and keep it separate for now?\nI don't know what that may do.  Let's just keep it simple and move.\n\n```\n</jeremygreer/Ideas/blog/site/\n▼ public/\n    01.txt\n    favicon.ico\n    index.html\n    manifest.json\n► src/\n  package.json\n  README.md\n  yarn.lock\n```\n\nOK, simple.  For the first pass, we'll just have links from the main site to\nthe resource.  That's kind of cool.  I like the resources be just plain old\ntext.  That makes them portable (they should probably be markdown though).\n\n...\n\nI just added a link from the boilerplate to the text file.  That works for\nnow.  It's ocurred to me that I will be referencing code a _lot_ in this - and\nin particular states.  I'll need a good way to document that.  Let's just rely\non Git for now.\n\nThere.  Check 31b6c302d2ee643ef22e943a6b9a38dc891f1c0b to see where things\nstand for now.  I'll have to make this project public and actually push it to\nGithub.  Maybe there's a good convention for referencing SHAs in a blog.  I\ndon't want to keep making Gists ever 12 seconds.\n\n...\n\nI just created the repo with the suggested name.  I haven't done that in a\nwhile.  https://github.com/reergymerej/silver-goggles\n\nNow it's very public.  I hope work doesn't watch my commits in Github if I get\ninspired in the middle of the day to do a little writing.\n\n...\n\nI'm trying to login to Heroku with the toolbelt, but I'm seeing some weird\nerrors.\n\n```\n~/Ideas/blog/site$ heroku login\n ▸    stat /Users/jeremygreer/.local/share/heroku/client/bin/heroku: not a directory\n ▸    fork/exec /Users/jeremygreer/.local/share/heroku/client/bin/heroku: not a directory\n ▸    stat /Users/jeremygreer/.local/share/heroku/client/bin/heroku: not a directory\n ▸    fork/exec /Users/jeremygreer/.local/share/heroku/client/bin/heroku: not a directory\n```\n\nI wonder if this is because of the High Sierra upgrade.  It smells like it, so\nI opened XCode because it needs to install dependencies and get my signature\non EULA and crap sometimes and I heard from work there may be something.  It\ncouldn't hurt.\n\nnope\n\nDoes it work from other directories where I used to use it?\n\nnope\n\nCan I reinstall it?  I think I used brew, but I'll just check Heroku.\n\n...wait...\n\nI've got down lots of rabbit holes.  This always happens.  What am I trying to\ndo?  Create an app in Heroku and get the URL.  I can do that through the GUI\neasily and figure out this crap later.\n\n...and done 1 minute later.\n\nI wonder if there's a way to timestamp each line of the text document.  That\nwould be cool to show _how long_ it takes to write the text.\n\n...\n\nDang it.\n\n```\n~/Ideas/blog/site$ git remote -v\norigin\tgit@github.com:reergymerej/silver-goggles.git (fetch)\norigin\tgit@github.com:reergymerej/silver-goggles.git (push)\n~/Ideas/blog/site$ git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/silver-goggles.git\n~/Ideas/blog/site$ git remote -v\nheroku\thttps://git.heroku.com/silver-goggles.git (fetch)\nheroku\thttps://git.heroku.com/silver-goggles.git (push)\norigin\tgit@github.com:reergymerej/silver-goggles.git (fetch)\norigin\tgit@github.com:reergymerej/silver-goggles.git (push)\n~/Ideas/blog/site$ git status\nOn branch master\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use \"git reset HEAD <file>...\" to unstage)\n\n\tmodified:   public/01.txt\n\n~/Ideas/blog/site$ fg\nnvim .\n\n[1]+  Stopped                 nvim .\n~/Ideas/blog/site$ git commit -m 'setup heroku remote'\n[master 5582472] setup heroku remote\n 1 file changed, 54 insertions(+)\n~/Ideas/blog/site$ git push heroku master\nremote: !\tYour account jeremy.greer@XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.com does not have access to silver-goggles.\nfatal: unable to access 'https://git.heroku.com/silver-goggles.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403\n~/Ideas/blog/site$ heroku login\n ▸    stat /Users/jeremygreer/.local/share/heroku/client/bin/heroku: not a directory\n ▸    fork/exec /Users/jeremygreer/.local/share/heroku/client/bin/heroku: not a directory\n ▸    stat /Users/jeremygreer/.local/share/heroku/client/bin/heroku: not a directory\n ▸    fork/exec /Users/jeremygreer/.local/share/heroku/client/bin/heroku: not a directory\n~/Ideas/blog/site$\n\n```\n\nI guess I'll have to login with the toolbelt afterall.  :D\n\n```\n  538  brew install heroku/brew/heroku\n  539  brew link --overwrite heroku\n  540  heroku login\n```\n\nProblem solved.

More than anything, I want this to be _REALLY_ easy to add\nentries to.  Ideally, it could even be a terminal thing that uploads after the\nfact.  I want it to be _very_ easy to add content.\n\nI also want a way for the reader to simulate being here with me while I go\nthrough things.  There's already the idea of timestamping text.  That's cool.\nI'll also want to show lots of terminal commands and results.  Maybe I can\njust route it to a file and include it as a resource.  Eventually, we'll want\nto include screenshots and/or videos/gifs as well.\n\nEric Elliot has his whole shotgun ride along thing.  That's cool, but video\nisn't searchable... unless it's transcribed.  Whatever.  I'm no Elliot.  I can\ndo my own thing here.\n\nOne consideration is, I want the content to be adaptable.  Right now it's just\nformatted text, so it looks like those old html spec docs you run into here\nand there.  It would be nice if, as the project progressed, the content is\ndisplayed better.  Adding markdown parsing is an obvious way to do that.  I'm\nnot sure right now about images and videos.\n\n\n#idea - I may run across passwords or email coming through in the text.  There\nshould be some type of auto-redact process.\n\n\nAs an aside, it's fun to start a project, even if it seems dumb, because you\nstart to get all these other ideas as you go along.  Another point is you are\nnever quite sure what the idea is at first.  It invariably changes as you go\nalong, which is part of what I want to capture here.\n\n...\n\nI know I can redirect the terminal output using `somecommand > file.txt`, but\nhow can I do it while also reading?\n\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/420981/how-do-i-save-terminal-output-to-a-file\n\n`tee` seems a good candidate, but I've never used it.  I only remember reading\nabout it in the Node docs.\n\n\n```\nman tee\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The tee utility copies standard input to standard output, making a copy\n     in zero or more files.  The output is unbuffered.\n```\n\nSo something like\n\n```\nprintenv | tee output.txt\n```\n\nwill show the environment variables _and_ save the output to the log.  That's\ncool for a single command, but I don't want to pipe everything.  I'll surely\nforget.\n\nAfter searching a bit, I've seen `script` referenced a few times.  I wonder if\nit would be useful to also log the things I'm searching and reading?  I bet\nso.  We'll have to figure out a way to include web history.\n\nLet's see what `script` is all about.\n\n\n```\nman script\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The script utility makes a typescript of everything printed on your terminal.  It is\n     useful for students who need a hardcopy record of an interactive session as proof of\n     an assignment, as the typescript file can be printed out later with lpr(1).\n\n```\n\nWow.  This is pretty close to perfect, except the result looks like garbage.\nThere's a log of formatting and whatnot in it.  Still...\n\n`script ./terminal.log` starts dumping all the output to `./terminal.log`\nuntil I call `exit`.  Pretty good.  Now how do we clear it up?\n\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/236930/how-to-clean-up-output-of-linux-script-command\n\n`col -bfp < terminal.log` seems pretty decent.  It fixes most of the\nformatting, but it looks like you can still see some weirdness like when I\ncompulsively clear the terminal with `cmd+k`.\n\nLet's to another quick test to see what it outputs.\n\nHere's the unprocessed version.\n\n```\nScript started on Fri Nov 17 19:08:34 2017\n\u001b[?1034hbash-3.2$ e\b\u001b[Kecho \"hello\"\r\nhello\r\nbash-3.2$ ls\r\nsite\t\tterminal.log\r\nbash-3.2$ cd site\r\nbash-3.2$ ls\r\nREADME.md\tnode_modules\tpackage.json\tpublic\t\tsrc\t\tyarn.lock\r\nbash-3.2$ man tee\r\n\u001b[?1049h\u001b[?1h\u001b=\r\r\nTEE(1)                    BSD General Commands Manual                   TEE(1)\r\n\r\n\u001b[1mNAME\u001b[0m\r\n     \u001b[1mtee\u001b[0m -- pipe fitting\r\n\r\n\u001b[1mSYNOPSIS\u001b[0m\r\n     \u001b[1mtee\u001b[0m [\u001b[1m-ai\u001b[0m] [\u001b[4mfile\u001b[24m \u001b[4m...\u001b[24m]\r\n\r\n\u001b[1mDESCRIPTION\u001b[0m\r\n     The \u001b[1mtee\u001b[0m utility copies standard input to standard output, making a copy in zero or\r\n     more files.

There were several detours until I finally snapped out of it\nand realized I was off course.  Adding my search results would be cool, but\nthat's not a priority right now.  I can include links.

I took a few notes in the README.  I've found that so much\nlearning happens tangentally to the task at hand.  I used to get so upset at\nall the rabbit holes when I just wanted to make a thing that did blah.  I've\nsince learned that much of the process _is_ the process of learning and\nexploring the many subtasks that stand between you and the objective.\n\nBack to the main task.  How do we make it easier to add entries?  I like the\nwhole new text file in an editor thing.  The terminal commands are being\nlogged easily enough.  Maybe we'll just make a quick script to read the\ndirectory and spit out some JSON the app can use.\n\ncurrent commit: fb4ee94, fb4ee94aba4a8a6c1dba60d3cfdc3a642bc5eafb\nhttps://github.com/reergymerej/silver-goggles/commit/fb4ee94\n\nWhoops.

Recording my screen and voice\nwould capture everything I want, mistakes and all, but it doesn't result in a\nsearchable string of text.\n\nHow can we go into \"record mode\" and capture:\n\n* code as it's written\n* terminal i/o\n* screenshots\n* commentary\n","resources":{"terminal":null}},{"uri":"/entries/06//commentary.txt","name":"06","commentary":"\nSat Nov 18 09:58:47 CST 2017\n\nThere are two issues I'm thinking of.  The first is how to record all the\ndata.  The second is how to present it.  I'm figuring out ways to manage the\nfirst right now, but I'd like the presentation to work outside of how the data\nis collected.  I don't want to dictate how it's done or what tools should be\nused.  That's not really flexible.  So, although I'm figuring it out as I go,\nI'll just skip over the recording part for now.\n\nThe second part, the presentation, is what I want to focus on.  We've already\ngot a way to read entries and show them in the browser, but let's do something\nmore elaborate.  At a basic level, each entry in the system will contain...\n\n\n* commentary - This is the meat of the system.  This is what I'm writing now\n  and will be the primary content.\n\n* resources - Various types of additional content that enhance, and may be\n  referenced by, the commentary.\n\n** terminal logs - what I typed, what came out\n\n** code - a Git log or something that can refer to code in a particular state\n\n** images - screenshots gathered for the commentary\n\n** web history - pages visited during the commentary\n\n\nEventually, I want a way to present all of these together and somehow synced\nby time.  For starters, though, let's just put them all together.\n\nHow will we describe them to the system?\n\n```\n{\n  \"commentary\": \"blah blah blah\",\n  \"resources\": []\n}\n```\n\nI want the resources grouped by type.\n\n```\n{\n  \"commentary\": \"blah blah blah\",\n  \"resources\": {\n    \"terminal\": \"blah blah blah\",\n    \"code\": \"xxx\",\n    \"images\": [\n    ],\n    \"web-history\": [\n    ],\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSome of these resource types will be ordered lists.  For consistency, let's\nmake them all ordered lists, even if they contain only one thing.\n\n\n```\n{\n  \"commentary\": \"blah blah blah\",\n  \"resources\": {\n    \"terminal\": [\n      \"blah blah blah\"\n    ],\n    \"code\": [\n      \"xxx\"\n    ],\n    \"images\": [\n      \"xxx\"\n    ],\n    \"web-history\": [\n      \"xxx\"\n    ],\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt is pretty easy to represent this stuff in the filesystem.  So we could have\neach entry (commentary, blog... I've got to figure out the names for things)\nreside in a directory.  That directory can optionally have subdirectories that\ndefine the attached resources.\n\nTODO: We'll have to standardize the resource names.\n\nBefore changing everything, let's rejigger the entries we spit out of our\n`index-entries.js` script and make sure the UI can understand this new\nstructure.  Then we can go back and change how the entries are read by the\nscript.\n\nref: 9a4b976641859fc2ce81abd57ba696a32348059d\n\nOK, this looks like a start.  Let's change the UI to show it the way we want.\n\n\nCrap.  I just realized we lost the names of the entries.  That's OK for now.\nThey weren't meaningful.  We should probably allow for them in the future,\nthough.  Either using dates or allowing optional titles or something.\n\n... There's no time like the present.  Let's add the name of the file for now.\n\nhttps://nodejs.org/api/path.html#path_path_basename_path_ext\n\n...\n\nThey data looks good, now let's get the entries rendering.\n\n31c1362\n\nWhoops.\n\n```\nFailed to compile\n./src/App.js\nSyntax error: Unexpected token (7:0)\n\n   5 |\n   6 | const Entry = () => (\n>  7 | )\n     | ^\n   8 |\n   9 | class App extends Component {\n  10 |   state = {\n```\n\n\nref: 36b4bc8\n\n```\nindex.js:2177 Warning: Unknown event handler property `onPress`.

Will it need to be a video?\n\n\nerror:\n\n```\n    at HTMLUnknownElement.callCallback (react-dom.development.js:540)\n    at Object.invokeGuardedCallbackDev (react-dom.development.js:579)\n    at invokeGuardedCallback (react-dom.development.js:436)\n    at renderRoot (react-dom.development.js:10386)\n```\n\nref: 498a6e9\n\n\nref: 39ee381\nOK, it's starting to look sane.\n\nNow, since we don't know how to show the resources yet, let's just go back to\nshowing the basic commentary.\n\n\nref: 1dd78d8\n\nCool.  Now we're getting somehere.  It's time to take a break.

Helping people seems to universally work as a way to find\\nmeaning.\tWhat can I help with?  \\\"Here's a website.  It will help you!\\\"  I\\ndon't know.\\n\\nMaybe starting a blog or some type of resource to help people learn to code\\nwould be cool.\tThere is no shortage of blogs or tech articles out there,\\nthough.  What could I do differently?\\n\\nOne thing you don't see is complete honesty.  It may be unprofessional and\\nmaybe severely undermine confidence, but what if someone showed you their\\nmistakes?  Not as a gag reel or some sort of ironic thing, but more as a\\ncandid view.  That may make things more approachable.  Mistakes are valuable\\nbecause you get to learn from them, so sharing your mistakes seems like it\\nwould increase the value.\\n\\nSo, the idea is not to be an unpolished slacker, but to provide complete\\nopenness along with instruction.\tTo start with, a blog probably shouldn't be\\na finished, beautiful product.  It's basically an open journal, right?\\nPunctuation and grammar are fine, but it should probably be pretty rough and\\nraw.\\n\\nSo here, what the heck.  Let's start with this.  I'm not sure where I'm going,\\nwhat the point is, or how it will turn out, but this is my project.\tFrom\\ninception to completion as transparent as possible, I'm going to document it.\\n\\n...\\n\\nIn the interest of _somewhat_ tolerable writing, I need to pick an audience,\\nthough.  I'm going to imagine...\\n\\nWell, I trailed off imagining myself at different points in my life when I was\\nlearing to program.\\n\\nScrew it.  I'm just going to talk to the terminal.  If I start talking to \\\"the\\naudience\\\" the tone will change and I'll start worrying too much about _how_\\nI'm saying things rather than _what_ I'm saying.\\n\\n...\\n\\nOK, so what are the goals?\\n\\n1.  Transparency - I want mistakes to be visible, ignorance to be highlighted,\\nand the documentation to be off the cuff.  This is to show that even\\nsuccessful dudes who have been writing and studying code for many years and\\nare pretty good at what they do are just regular guys full of doubt,\\nignorance, and potential mistakes.\\n\\n2.  Create a Blog - The blog should be super easy to update (to encourage it\\nhappen regularly), provide lots of detail, and have very \\\"raw\\\" content.\\n\\nI would like to get something up ASAP, so that it doesn't all appear at once\\nat the end of the project.  Honestly, most (practically all) of my projects\\ndie the day after I start them.  I get really pumped, start working, get\\nsidetracked with infrastructure or find another cooler idea along the way...\\nThere's always something, so the sooner I can get this \\\"launched\\\" the better\\nchange it has of surviving past next week.\\n\\n\\nWhat's the absolute fastest way to get an app out there into the world?  This\\nis not a paid promotion, but I bet I can get this into the world in the next\\n10 minutes with CRA and Heroku.\\n\\nHere's the plan.\\n\\n1.  create the app\\n2.\tpost this as static content\\n3.  deploy as a new free app in Heroku\\n\\n\\n(Side note: It's going to become a pain in the ass documenting all of this\\nstuff.  Maybe I could just log the terminal history or something.)\\n\\n```\\ncreate-react-app site\\n```\\n\\nI may elaborate on all this stuff later, but maybe not.  There are plenty of\\nsources out there already.\\n\\nThis file is 01.txt in the dir above the `site` dir I just created.\\n\\n```\\n/Users/jeremygreer/Ideas/blog/\\n▼ site/\\n  ► public/\\n  ► src/\\n\t  package.json\\n    README.md\\n    yarn.lock\\n\t01.txt\\n```\\n\\nI'm sure I'll have resources _other_ than the site, but now I need to move the\\ntext into the site.  What if I just symlink it and keep it separate for now?\\nI don't know what that may do.  Let's just keep it simple and move.\\n\\n```\\n</jeremygreer/Ideas/blog/site/\\n▼ public/\\n\t01.txt\\n    favicon.ico\\n    index.html\\n    manifest.json\\n► src/\\n  package.json\\n  README.md\\n  yarn.lock\\n```\\n\\nOK, simple.  For the first pass, we'll just have links from the main site to\\nthe resource.  That's kind of cool.\tI like the resources be just plain old\\ntext.  That makes them portable (they should probably be markdown though).\\n\\n...\\n\\nI just added a link from the boilerplate to the text file.  That works for\\nnow.  It's ocurred to me that I will be referencing code a _lot_ in this - and\\nin particular states.\tI'll need a good way to document that.\tLet's just rely\\non Git for now.\\n\\nThere.  Check 31b6c302d2ee643ef22e943a6b9a38dc891f1c0b to see where things\\nstand for now.\tI'll have to make this project public and actually push it to\\nGithub.\tMaybe there's a good convention for referencing SHAs in a blog.  I\\ndon't want to keep making Gists ever 12 seconds.\\n\\n...\\n\\nI just created the repo with the suggested name.  I haven't done that in a\\nwhile.  https://github.com/reergymerej/silver-goggles\\n\\nNow it's very public.  I hope work doesn't watch my commits in Github if I get\\ninspired in the middle of the day to do a little writing.\\n\\n...\\n\\nI'm trying to login to Heroku with the toolbelt, but I'm seeing some weird\\nerrors.\\n\\n```\\n~/Ideas/blog/site$ heroku login\\n ▸    stat /Users/jeremygreer/.local/share/heroku/client/bin/heroku: not a directory\\n ▸\t fork/exec /Users/jeremygreer/.local/share/heroku/client/bin/heroku: not a directory\\n ▸    stat /Users/jeremygreer/.local/share/heroku/client/bin/heroku: not a directory\\n ▸\t  fork/exec /Users/jeremygreer/.local/share/heroku/client/bin/heroku: not a directory\\n```\\n\\nI wonder if this is because of the High Sierra upgrade.  It smells like it, so\\nI opened XCode because it needs to install dependencies and get my signature\\non EULA and crap sometimes and I heard from work there may be something.  It\\ncouldn't hurt.\\n\\nnope\\n\\nDoes it work from other directories where I used to use it?\\n\\nnope\\n\\nCan I reinstall it?\tI think I used brew, but I'll just check Heroku.\\n\\n...wait...\\n\\nI've got down lots of rabbit holes.

For starters, though, let's just put them all together.\\n\\nHow will we describe them to the system?\\n\\n```\\n{\\n  \\\"commentary\\\": \\\"blah blah blah\\\",\\n  \\\"resources\\\": []\\n}\\n```\\n\\nI want the resources grouped by type.\\n\\n```\\n{\\n  \\\"commentary\\\": \\\"blah blah blah\\\",\\n  \\\"resources\\\": {\\n\t \\\"terminal\\\": \\\"blah blah blah\\\",\\n\t\\\"code\\\": \\\"xxx\\\",\\n\t\\\"images\\\": [\\n    ],\\n    \\\"web-history\\\": [\\n    ],\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nSome of these resource types will be ordered lists.

It's becoming more difficult to create an entry.  It's not exactly hard,\nbut I want to make it dummy proof.\n\n2.  Since we're creating an inventory in JSON of the entries (to simulate a\nDB) we don't really _have_ to keep the assets in the public part.  However, I\ndig the graceful degredation.  For whatever reason, if there's no JS, the\nassets are still out there and understandable.  Again, the text commentary is\nthe real data.  Everything else is just presentation.  Let's leave the assets\npublic so they can exist \"on their own.\"\n\n\nLet's deal with #1 first.  We could script something, but... meh... I don't\nwant focus on _how_ the assets are created.  For now, we'll just put a note in\nthe README of what to do when starting a new entry.\n\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/3637660/how-to-exclude-file-only-from-root-folder-in-git\n\nref:git:934b4d9\n\n...\n\nSo to support non-js environments, theoretical old webspiders and paranoid\nnerds with text-based browsers, let's change the links in our UI to point to\nthe static assets.  If JS is off, the native browser instructions will still\nwork.\n\nref:git:87bc6e2\n\nIt works, not let's refactor a bit.\n\nref:git:ffe7031\n\nLooking good.\n\n...\n\nOne of the problems I see a lot is preemptive design.  It generally takes the\nform of a bunch of people who don't really understand the problem, half-paying\nattention, prescribing technical designs geared toward showing the other\npeople in the room how smart they are.  That's usually through extensive\ncomplexity or anticipation of all sorts of scenarios that may (or probably\n_won't_) come up.\n\nThis is lame.\n\nIt breeds complexity and creates a ton of burden on the system.  Those things\nlead to bugs and systems that almost impossible to comprehend and terrible to\nwork in.\n\nI get the appeal, though.  It's fun to brainstorm and think of all the what\nifs, but it's like a paranoia.  I'm not advocating for driving blind, just\nmaking small sensible improvements.  Along those lines, I'm sure I could sit\nwith a whiteboard or notepad and figure out the optimal data structure for the\nentities we're using here, a system to succinctly reference related assets,\nand a clever way to tie it all together, but there's a very real danger I\ncould get stuck in some planning mania.  I'd end up in a frenzy of design and\neventually have system with lots of complexity, mandated only by my\nimagination.  And I'd probably have lots of oversights, too.\n\nIt's fun to do this and I've done it many times, but we're doing something\ndifferent here.  It's all baby steps.  As an example, I know we want to\nreference resources from our commentary somehow, but I'm not sure _how_ we're\ngoing to do that yet.  I put in some links and a few `ref` notes.  Those have\nevolved naturally to include the _type_ of resource as well as the unique ID,\nso now it's `ref:git:ffe7031`.  The data structure has evolved in a similar\nway as you've seen, just like the way we create new entries and save logs has\nchanged due to necessity.  My hope is that allowing things to evolve\norganically like this will provide a much more natural, enjoyable, and stable\nsystem that one designed beforehand.\n","resources":{"terminal":{"uri":"/entries/08/terminal.log","content":"Script started on Sat Nov 18 12:40:53 2017\n?1034hbash-3.2$ git status\nOn branch master\nYour branch is up-to-date

Now\nlet's spice up the entries themselves.  Let's turn the commit hashes into\nlinks to the source code.\n\nWe don't want to alter the actual entries, though, just add a presentation\ntweak.  We'll do this at first by just doing a simple find/replace type trick\non the text in Entry.js.  Currently, it just renders the text in a `<pre>`\ntag.  That's pretty nice, so we'll keep most of it like that.  Except we'll\nwant to replace any of our Git references with a link.  That means our\ncontents will change from\n\n```\n<pre>{...}</pre>\n```\n\nto\n\n```\n<pre>{...}</pre>\n<a />\n<pre>{...}</pre>\n<a />\n<pre>{...}</pre>\n```\n\nFirst, we'll hardcode some bunk data to see that it works alright.\n\nref:git:ebc4e61\n\nSeems good.  Now we need to process the commentary string and return an array\nof components, preformatted blocks for just text or anchor tags for our\nreferences.\n\nref:git:35a23a2\n\nThis is a test to see how it will work.  It seems to be OK.  Now, instead of\nreturning random crap in `parseCommentary`, we're going to actually split it\nbased on our reference tags.  It may be ametuerish, but I like doing stuff\nlike this in the debugger, so I'm going to put a breakpoint there and tinker\nuntil I get the regex right.\n\nI've just added a screenshot of this.  Although we don't know how to handle\nthose yet, it's pretty clear we'll need to reference them somehow, so we'll\njust go with the same convention.\n\nref:images:01.png\n\nWe've got some regex now to find all the instances in a commentary string.  We\ncan keep calling `exec` and get the substring match until it's exhausted.  I\ndon't remember exactly how to deal with splitting this stuff up, but I'm\nbetting we can use replace in a pretty straightforward way.\n\nref:images:02.png\n\nMy regex needed a little tweaking.  Match looks good because it returns an\narray, but we don't get the captured group or the stuff between the matches.\n\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split\n\n\nWe're getting close.\n\nref:git:3ba51c1\nref:images:03.png\n\nThe first goal is to get the stuff to show.  After that, we can tweak it to\nmake it work better.\n\nI'm finding that for little commentary, I can use Git with a quick commit\nmessage.\n\nref:git:67b4a28\n\nThis is probably a huge misuse of Git, but what the heck.\n\nref:git:de74344\n\nWe are now splitting them apart correctly.  Now to update the component so it\npoints to the commit in Git.\n\nref:git:545f389\n\nThere it is.  It's working in all its ugliness.  This is a good time to stop\nand take a victory lap.\n","resources":{"terminal":{"uri":"/entries/10/terminal.log","content":"Script started on Sat Nov 18 15:57:59 2017\n?1034hbash-3.2$ ls\nREADME.md\tbuild\t\tpackage.json\tpublic\t\tsrc\t\tyarn.lock\nREADME.md~\tnode_modules\tpackage.json~\tscripts \tterminal.log\nbash-3.2$ mvKgit mv src/KpK\u0007\nApp.css \t\t  ClickableEntry.js\t    index.css\nApp.css~\t\t  ClickableEntry.js~\t    index.js\nApp.js\t\t\t  Entry.js\t\t    logo.svg\nApp.js~ \t\t  Entry.js~\t\t    registerServiceWorker.js\nApp.test.js\t\t  entries.json\nbash-3.2$ git mv srcKpublic/terminal-logs/03.terminal.log public/entries/03/terminal.log\nbash-3.2$ git status\nOn branch master\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use \"git reset HEAD <file>...\" to unstage)\n\n\t32mrenamed:    public/terminal-logs/03.terminal.log -> public/entries/03/terminal.logm\n\nbash-3.2$ git commit -m 'move log for 03 in place'\n[master 240019a] move log for 03 in place\n 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)\n rename public/{terminal-logs/03.terminal.log => entries/03/terminal.log} (100%)\nbash-3.2$ ./scripts/index-entries.js\nbash-3.2$ mkdir public/entries/10/\nbash-3.2$ touch public/entries/10/commentary.Ktxt\nbash-3.2$ git status\nOn branch master\nYour branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.\n  (use \"git push\" to publish your local commits)\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git checkout -- <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n\n\t31mmodified:   src/Entry.jsm\n\t31mmodified:   src/entries.jsonm\n\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n\n\t31mpublic/entries/10/m\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\nbash-3.2$ git add src/Entry.js\nbash-3.2$ git commit -m '' --allow-empty-commit\nerror: unknown option `allow-empty-commit'\nusage: git commit [<options>] [--] <pathspec>...\n\n    -q, --quiet \t  suppress summary after successful commit\n    -v, --verbose\t  show diff in commit message template\n\nCommit message options\n    -F, --file <file>\t  read message from file\n    --author <author>\t  override author for commit\n    --date <date>\t  override date for commit\n    -m, --message <message>\n\t\t\t  commit message\n    -c, --reedit-message <commit>\n\t\t\t  reuse and edit message from specified commit\n    -C, --reuse-message <commit>\n\t\t\t  reuse message from specified commit\n    --fixup <commit>\t  use autosquash formatted message to fixup specified commit\n    --squash <commit>\t  use autosquash formatted message to squash specified commit\n    --reset-author\t  the commit is authored by me now (used with -C/-c/--amend)\n    -s, --signoff\t  add Signed-off-by:\n    -t, --template <file>\n\t\t\t  use specified template file\n    -e, --edit\t\t  force edit of commit\n    --cleanup <default>   how to strip spaces and #comments from message\n    --status\t\t  include status in commit message template\n    -S, --gpg-sign[=<key-id>]\n\t\t\t  GPG sign commit\n\nCommit contents options\n    -a, --all\t\t  commit all changed files\n    -i, --include\t  add specified files to index for commit\n    --interactive\t  interactively add files\n    -p, --patch \t  interactively add changes\n    -o, --only\t\t  commit only specified files\n    -n, --no-verify\t  bypass pre-commit hook\n    --dry-run\t\t  show what would be committed\n    --short\t\t  show status concisely\n    --branch\t\t  show branch information\n    --porcelain \t  machine-readable output\n    --long\t\t  show status in long format (default)\n    -z, --null\t\t  terminate entries with NUL\n    --amend\t\t  amend previous commit\n    --no-post-rewrite\t  bypass post-rewrite hook\n    -u, --untracked-files[=<mode>]\n\t\t\t  show untracked files, optional modes: all, normal, no.

We can\neventually have something like this where various resources are contained in\nan accordion.  That means we'd have something like\n\nResourcePanel\n  Resource\n\n\nStop.  I'm getting that engineering bug again.  Let's just render the diff in\nan iframe when we click on it.\n\n...\n\nFirst, real quick, because it's bothering the crap out of my not having it,\nwe're going to set up the linters.  I'm not going to comment on it, just do it\nand share the commit afterward.\n\nHey, the terminal logging should come in handy too!\n\nref:git:e22e421\n\nThat's better.  I hate setting that up.  There are so many rabbit holes to go\ndown.\n\nUpon reflection, I should have split that up into two parts: adding the linter\nsetup and fixing the code.  It would have made it easier for you to see in the\ndiff.  Live and learn.\n\nThe main tricks are to use `./node_modules/.bin/eslint --init`, walk through\nthe questionaire, change the parser to `babel-eslint`, leave only the jsx\nparserOptions config and set the suggested react/jsx-uses-react.  Check the\ndiff or the terminal log for more details.\n\n...\n\nNow where were we?\n\nLet's render an iframe with our Github stuff when we click on a git ref.\n\nref:git:7d419bf\nref:images:01.png\n\nWhoops.\n\n```\nUncaught TypeError: _this.props.onSelect is not a function\n    at GitRefBlock._this.handleClick (GitRefBlock.js:6)\n    at HTMLUnknownElement.callCallback (react-dom.development.js:540)\n    at Object.invokeGuardedCallbackDev (react-dom.development.js:579)\n    at Object.invokeGuardedCallback (react-dom.development.js:436\n```\n\nDouble-whoops.  Not only do we need to start using proptypes to catch this\nsimple stuff, I need to stop relying on images.  They should only be used as a\nlast resort.  The whole point of this thing is it's text-based so you can\neasily find stuff.  Error stacks in screenshots don't do us a lot of good.\n\nref:git:b0d7648\n\nref:git:5744667\n\nNow we've got it logging something when we click.  We chained the handler up a\nfew levels, which is tedious, but it's explicit and easy to follow.  Trickery\nlike spreading props and calling the handler meant for Parent from Child save\na little time, but they lead to confusion later.\n\nSo looking at the page heirarchy, we've got a list of entries, the current\nentry, and now we need the resources.  We'll need to pass the event up one\nmore layer to get to the shared root for all three.\n\nref:git:ab0fa7e\n\nThat gets the event up to App.js for us.  Now that it's here, we just set\nstate with the currently selected resource and render an iframe.\n\nref:git:14cdd95\n\nI just anticipated a bug - after opening an entry then opening a resource, you\nselect a new entry but the old resource remains open - which was fixed easily\nby clearing the `currentResource`, but it feels bad.  Originally, I wanted to\nmaintain the heirarchy - the resources should be within the Entry - but I made\nthem siblings in the app.  Not only did this require bouncing the callback one\nlevel higher, it just introduced more cleanup logic.  If the resources were\nall contained within the Entry, neither would be an issue.  I let the CSS\nconvenience dictate the design of the components, which is dumb.\n\nWe'll have to come back and fix that.  See how quickly the \"tech debt\nsnowplow\" starts going?  Be careful.\n\n...\n\nref:git:7174d6a\n\nWe're almost there, except.\n\n```\nRefused to display 'https://github.com/reergymerej/silver-goggles/commit/25e4819' in a frame because an ancestor violates the following Content Security Policy directive: \"frame-ancestors 'none'\".\n```\n\nI have not seen that before.  Is the becaue of the Webpack server?\n\nThis seems reasonable.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/38068052/1319850\n\nI wonder if the .diff version will work.\n\nAppending `.diff` did not work.  Github really does not want you stealing\ntheir stuff.  That's understandable.\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/38535491/trying-to-render-i-frame-ancestor-violates-the-following-content-security-polic\n\nI guess this answers the earlier question about whether or not the patches\nshould be part of this code.  They should.\n\n\nHowever, tonight is done.  We will do it tomorrow.\n\n\nSat Nov 18 21:49:05 CST 2017\n","resources":{"terminal":{"uri":"/entries/12/terminal.log","content":"Script started on Sat Nov 18 20:14:35 2017\n?1034hbash-3.2$ git
