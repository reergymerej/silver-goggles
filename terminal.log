[{"name":"01","commentary":"So I was thinking I'd like to do something meaningful.  What in the world\ncould that be?  Helping people seems to universally work as a way to find\nmeaning.  What can I help with?  \"Here's a website.  It will help you!\"  I\ndon't know.\n\nMaybe starting a blog or some type of resource to help people learn to code\nwould be cool.  There is no shortage of blogs or tech articles out there,\nthough.  What could I do differently?\n\nOne thing you don't see is complete honesty.  It may be unprofessional and\nmaybe severely undermine confidence, but what if someone showed you their\nmistakes?  Not as a gag reel or some sort of ironic thing, but more as a\ncandid view.  That may make things more approachable.  Mistakes are valuable\nbecause you get to learn from them, so sharing your mistakes seems like it\nwould increase the value.\n\nSo, the idea is not to be an unpolished slacker, but to provide complete\nopenness along with instruction.  To start with, a blog probably shouldn't be\na finished, beautiful product.  It's basically an open journal, right?\nPunctuation and grammar are fine, but it should probably be pretty rough and\nraw.\n\nSo here, what the heck.  Let's start with this.  I'm not sure where I'm going,\nwhat the point is, or how it will turn out, but this is my project.  From\ninception to completion as transparent as possible, I'm going to document it.\n\n...\n\nIn the interest of _somewhat_ tolerable writing, I need to pick an audience,\nthough.  I'm going to imagine...\n\nWell, I trailed off imagining myself at different points in my life when I was\nlearing to program.\n\nScrew it.  I'm just going to talk to the terminal.  If I start talking to \"the\naudience\" the tone will change and I'll start worrying too much about _how_\nI'm saying things rather than _what_ I'm saying.\n\n...\n\nOK, so what are the goals?\n\n1.  Transparency - I want mistakes to be visible, ignorance to be highlighted,\nand the documentation to be off the cuff.  This is to show that even\nsuccessful dudes who have been writing and studying code for many years and\nare pretty good at what they do are just regular guys full of doubt,\nignorance, and potential mistakes.\n\n2.  Create a Blog - The blog should be super easy to update (to encourage it\nhappen regularly), provide lots of detail, and have very \"raw\" content.\n\nI would like to get something up ASAP, so that it doesn't all appear at once\nat the end of the project.  Honestly, most (practically all) of my projects\ndie the day after I start them.  I get really pumped, start working, get\nsidetracked with infrastructure or find another cooler idea along the way...\nThere's always something, so the sooner I can get this \"launched\" the better\nchange it has of surviving past next week.\n\n\nWhat's the absolute fastest way to get an app out there into the world?  This\nis not a paid promotion, but I bet I can get this into the world in the next\n10 minutes with CRA and Heroku.\n\nHere's the plan.\n\n1.  create the app\n2.  post this as static content\n3.  deploy as a new free app in Heroku\n\n\n(Side note: It's going to become a pain in the ass documenting all of this\nstuff.  Maybe I could just log the terminal history or something.)\n\n```\ncreate-react-app site\n```\n\nI may elaborate on all this stuff later, but maybe not.  There are plenty of\nsources out there already.\n\nThis file is 01.txt in the dir above the `site` dir I just created.\n\n```\n/Users/jeremygreer/Ideas/blog/\nâ–¼ site/\n  â–º public/\n  â–º src/\n    package.json\n    README.md\n    yarn.lock\n  01.txt\n```\n\nI'm sure I'll have resources _other_ than the site, but now I need to move the\ntext into the site.  What if I just symlink it and keep it separate for now?\nI don't know what that may do.  Let's just keep it simple and move.\n\n```\n</jeremygreer/Ideas/blog/site/\nâ–¼ public/\n    01.txt\n    favicon.ico\n    index.html\n    manifest.json\nâ–º src/\n  package.json\n  README.md\n  yarn.lock\n```\n\nOK, simple.  For the first pass, we'll just have links from the main site to\nthe resource.  That's kind of cool.  I like the resources be just plain old\ntext.  That makes them portable (they should probably be markdown though).\n\n...\n\nI just added a link from the boilerplate to the text file.  That works for\nnow.  It's ocurred to me that I will be referencing code a _lot_ in this - and\nin particular states.  I'll need a good way to document that.  Let's just rely\non Git for now.\n\nThere.  Check 31b6c302d2ee643ef22e943a6b9a38dc891f1c0b to see where things\nstand for now.  I'll have to make this project public and actually push it to\nGithub.  Maybe there's a good convention for referencing SHAs in a blog.  I\ndon't want to keep making Gists ever 12 seconds.\n\n...\n\nI just created the repo with the suggested name.  I haven't done that in a\nwhile.  https://github.com/reergymerej/silver-goggles\n\nNow it's very public.  I hope work doesn't watch my commits in Github if I get\ninspired in the middle of the day to do a little writing.\n\n...\n\nI'm trying to login to Heroku with the toolbelt, but I'm seeing some weird\nerrors.\n\n```\n~/Ideas/blog/site$ heroku login\n â–¸    stat /Users/jeremygreer/.local/share/heroku/client/bin/heroku: not a directory\n â–¸    fork/exec /Users/jeremygreer/.local/share/heroku/client/bin/heroku: not a directory\n â–¸    stat /Users/jeremygreer/.local/share/heroku/client/bin/heroku: not a directory\n â–¸    fork/exec /Users/jeremygreer/.local/share/heroku/client/bin/heroku: not a directory\n```\n\nI wonder if this is because of the High Sierra upgrade.  It smells like it, so\nI opened XCode because it needs to install dependencies and get my signature\non EULA and crap sometimes and I heard from work there may be something.  It\ncouldn't hurt.\n\nnope\n\nDoes it work from other directories where I used to use it?\n\nnope\n\nCan I reinstall it?  I think I used brew, but I'll just check Heroku.\n\n...wait...\n\nI've got down lots of rabbit holes.  This always happens.  What am I trying to\ndo?  Create an app in Heroku and get the URL.  I can do that through the GUI\neasily and figure out this crap later.\n\n...and done 1 minute later.\n\nI wonder if there's a way to timestamp each line of the text document.  That\nwould be cool to show _how long_ it takes to write the text.\n\n...\n\nDang it.\n\n```\n~/Ideas/blog/site$ git remote -v\norigin\tgit@github.com:reergymerej/silver-goggles.git (fetch)\norigin\tgit@github.com:reergymerej/silver-goggles.git (push)\n~/Ideas/blog/site$ git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/silver-goggles.git\n~/Ideas/blog/site$ git remote -v\nheroku\thttps://git.heroku.com/silver-goggles.git (fetch)\nheroku\thttps://git.heroku.com/silver-goggles.git (push)\norigin\tgit@github.com:reergymerej/silver-goggles.git (fetch)\norigin\tgit@github.com:reergymerej/silver-goggles.git (push)\n~/Ideas/blog/site$ git status\nOn branch master\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use \"git reset HEAD <file>...\" to unstage)\n\n\tmodified:   public/01.txt\n\n~/Ideas/blog/site$ fg\nnvim .\n\n[1]+  Stopped                 nvim .\n~/Ideas/blog/site$ git commit -m 'setup heroku remote'\n[master 5582472] setup heroku remote\n 1 file changed, 54 insertions(+)\n~/Ideas/blog/site$ git push heroku master\nremote: !\tYour account jeremy.greer@XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.com does not have access to silver-goggles.\nfatal: unable to access 'https://git.heroku.com/silver-goggles.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403\n~/Ideas/blog/site$ heroku login\n â–¸    stat /Users/jeremygreer/.local/share/heroku/client/bin/heroku: not a directory\n â–¸    fork/exec /Users/jeremygreer/.local/share/heroku/client/bin/heroku: not a directory\n â–¸    stat /Users/jeremygreer/.local/share/heroku/client/bin/heroku: not a directory\n â–¸    fork/exec /Users/jeremygreer/.local/share/heroku/client/bin/heroku: not a directory\n~/Ideas/blog/site$\n\n```\n\nI guess I'll have to login with the toolbelt afterall.  :D\n\n```\n  538  brew install heroku/brew/heroku\n  539  brew link --overwrite heroku\n  540  heroku login\n```\n\nProblem solved.
