This is a test to verify that new entries show up.  I also just committed the
log for the terminal.  Another problem has come up.  Those logs need to be
tied to the entries.  For now, we'll just manually rename the to match the
filename of the entry it corresponds to.

It's not showing the new entry in heroku.  I don't think the build step is
happening, so I added

```
    "heroku-postbuild": "./scripts/index-entries.js",
```

to package.json.  The movie my wife is watching is ending as is our session!
Oh no!  I'm panicking.
