While driving to the store and whatnot I got a chance to think about this a
little bit more.  More than anything, I want this to be _REALLY_ easy to add
entries to.  Ideally, it could even be a terminal thing that uploads after the
fact.  I want it to be _very_ easy to add content.

I also want a way for the reader to simulate being here with me while I go
through things.  There's already the idea of timestamping text.  That's cool.
I'll also want to show lots of terminal commands and results.  Maybe I can
just route it to a file and include it as a resource.  Eventually, we'll want
to include screenshots and/or videos/gifs as well.

Eric Elliot has his whole shotgun ride along thing.  That's cool, but video
isn't searchable... unless it's transcribed.  Whatever.  I'm no Elliot.  I can
do my own thing here.

One consideration is, I want the content to be adaptable.  Right now it's just
formatted text, so it looks like those old html spec docs you run into here
and there.  It would be nice if, as the project progressed, the content is
displayed better.  Adding markdown parsing is an obvious way to do that.  I'm
not sure right now about images and videos.


#idea - I may run across passwords or email coming through in the text.  There
should be some type of auto-redact process.


As an aside, it's fun to start a project, even if it seems dumb, because you
start to get all these other ideas as you go along.  Another point is you are
never quite sure what the idea is at first.  It invariably changes as you go
along, which is part of what I want to capture here.
