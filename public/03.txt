It's starting to become clear that we - I like saying "we" a lot when talking
about projects.  I don't know if it's to share credit with everyone or to
minimize the "I" references - need a better way to add entries.

...

As I was taking out the garbage, the idea for this started to change a bit.
There are several things I want to show.  My thoughts, coming through in text,
the commands and responses in the terminal, shown in the logs we're keeping
now, search/web history, code at different stages, and probably screenshots
later.  What if this could all be syncronized somehow?  Then the reader could
go through the text and see links to the code, images as we refer to them, a
sideline of the links we visited, and the commands/results in the terminal.  I
suppose all of this kind of _is_ a web page.  The challenge comes from
aggregating all the stuff.

...

I don't know how to synchronize the text to a timeline...not sure if that's
even useful...but I can add timestamps to the files or blocks easily enough.

One of the problems I run into constantly is distraction.  I just had to reel
myself back in from looking at the code used to write a Chrome plugin that
exports history to see if I could use a similar thing to include my browsing
history here.  There were several detours until I finally snapped out of it
and realized I was off course.  Adding my search results would be cool, but
that's not a priority right now.  I can include links.  Evenutally, it may be
a priority, but it's a distraction at this phase.  Shake it off and focus.

So what the heck are we doing?  We're trying to figure out a way to make
adding entries easier.

... and immediately I'm distracted...

I will probably forget the commands I've figured out that I want to use here,
so I'm going to note them in the README.
