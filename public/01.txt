So I was thinking I'd like to do something meaningful.  What in the world
could that be?  Helping people seems to universally work as a way to find
meaning.  What can I help with?  "Here's a website.  It will help you!"  I
don't know.

Maybe starting a blog or some type of resource to help people learn to code
would be cool.  There is no shortage of blogs or tech articles out there,
though.  What could I do differently?

One thing you don't see is complete honesty.  It may be unprofessional and
maybe severely undermine confidence, but what if someone showed you their
mistakes?  Not as a gag reel or some sort of ironic thing, but more as a
candid view.  That may make things more approachable.  Mistakes are valuable
because you get to learn from them, so sharing your mistakes seems like it
would increase the value.

So, the idea is not to be an unpolished slacker, but to provide complete
openness along with instruction.  To start with, a blog probably shouldn't be
a finished, beautiful product.  It's basically an open journal, right?
Punctuation and grammar are fine, but it should probably be pretty rough and
raw.

So here, what the heck.  Let's start with this.  I'm not sure where I'm going,
what the point is, or how it will turn out, but this is my project.  From
inception to completion as transparent as possible, I'm going to document it.

...

In the interest of _somewhat_ tolerable writing, I need to pick an audience,
though.  I'm going to imagine...

Well, I trailed off imagining myself at different points in my life when I was
learing to program.

Screw it.  I'm just going to talk to the terminal.  If I start talking to "the
audience" the tone will change and I'll start worrying too much about _how_
I'm saying things rather than _what_ I'm saying.

...

OK, so what are the goals?

1.  Transparency - I want mistakes to be visible, ignorance to be highlighted,
and the documentation to be off the cuff.  This is to show that even
successful dudes who have been writing and studying code for many years and
are pretty good at what they do are just regular guys full of doubt,
ignorance, and potential mistakes.

2.  Create a Blog - The blog should be super easy to update (to encourage it
happen regularly), provide lots of detail, and have very "raw" content.

I would like to get something up ASAP, so that it doesn't all appear at once
at the end of the project.  Honestly, most (practically all) of my projects
die the day after I start them.  I get really pumped, start working, get
sidetracked with infrastructure or find another cooler idea along the way...
There's always something, so the sooner I can get this "launched" the better
change it has of surviving past next week.


What's the absolute fastest way to get an app out there into the world?  This
is not a paid promotion, but I bet I can get this into the world in the next
10 minutes with CRA and Heroku.

Here's the plan.

1.  create the app
2.  post this as static content
3.  deploy as a new free app in Heroku


(Side note: It's going to become a pain in the ass documenting all of this
stuff.  Maybe I could just log the terminal history or something.)

```
create-react-app site
```

I may elaborate on all this stuff later, but maybe not.  There are plenty of
sources out there already.

This file is 01.txt in the dir above the `site` dir I just created.

```
/Users/jeremygreer/Ideas/blog/
▼ site/
  ► public/
  ► src/
    package.json
    README.md
    yarn.lock
  01.txt
```

I'm sure I'll have resources _other_ than the site, but now I need to move the
text into the site.  What if I just symlink it and keep it separate for now?
I don't know what that may do.  Let's just keep it simple and move.

```
</jeremygreer/Ideas/blog/site/
▼ public/
    01.txt
    favicon.ico
    index.html
    manifest.json
► src/
  package.json
  README.md
  yarn.lock
```

OK, simple.  For the first pass, we'll just have links from the main site to
the resource.  That's kind of cool.  I like the resources be just plain old
text.  That makes them portable (they should probably be markdown though).

...

I just added a link from the boilerplate to the text file.  That works for
now.  It's ocurred to me that I will be referencing code a _lot_ in this - and
in particular states.  I'll need a good way to document that.  Let's just rely
on Git for now.

There.  Check 31b6c302d2ee643ef22e943a6b9a38dc891f1c0b to see where things
stand for now.  I'll have to make this project public and actually push it to
Github.  Maybe there's a good convention for referencing SHAs in a blog.  I
don't want to keep making Gists ever 12 seconds.

...

I just created the repo with the suggested name.  I haven't done that in a
while.  https://github.com/reergymerej/silver-goggles

Now it's very public.  I hope work doesn't watch my commits in Github if I get
inspired in the middle of the day to do a little writing.

...

I'm trying to login to Heroku with the toolbelt, but I'm seeing some weird
errors.

```
~/Ideas/blog/site$ heroku login
 ▸    stat /Users/jeremygreer/.local/share/heroku/client/bin/heroku: not a directory
 ▸    fork/exec /Users/jeremygreer/.local/share/heroku/client/bin/heroku: not a directory
 ▸    stat /Users/jeremygreer/.local/share/heroku/client/bin/heroku: not a directory
 ▸    fork/exec /Users/jeremygreer/.local/share/heroku/client/bin/heroku: not a directory
```

I wonder if this is because of the High Sierra upgrade.  It smells like it, so
I opened XCode because it needs to install dependencies and get my signature
on EULA and crap sometimes and I heard from work there may be something.  It
couldn't hurt.

nope

Does it work from other directories where I used to use it?

nope

Can I reinstall it?  I think I used brew, but I'll just check Heroku.

...wait...

I've got down lots of rabbit holes.  This always happens.  What am I trying to
do?  Create an app in Heroku and get the URL.  I can do that through the GUI
easily and figure out this crap later.

...and done 1 minute later.

I wonder if there's a way to timestamp each line of the text document.  That
would be cool to show _how long_ it takes to write the text.

...

Dang it.

I guess I'll have to login with the toolbelt afterall.  :D

```
  538  brew install heroku/brew/heroku
  539  brew link --overwrite heroku
  540  heroku login
```

Problem solved.  I have to use my personal credentials instead of work.  I
installed a Heroku plugin to manage both, but it never seemed to work.  I just
get my password from Lastpass and login manually.  It's often easier to do
things the dumb way.
