This idea is starting to crystalize.  The problem is anyway.  It is difficult
to write about code in a useful way.  There is code everywhere and lots of
articles about it, often accompanied by code snippets or repos, but it seems
like there could be a better way to do it.  Recording my screen and voice
would capture everything I want, mistakes and all, but it doesn't result in a
searchable string of text.

How can we go into "record mode" and capture:

* code as it's written
* terminal i/o
* screenshots
* commentary
