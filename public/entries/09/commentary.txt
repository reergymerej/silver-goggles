Let's show some resources!

        commentary.txt
        terminal.log
    ▼ 08/
        commentary.txt
        terminal.log
```

#note Maybe directory trees are another type of resource we want to show.

I thought read would fail for missing files, so this isn't really unexpected.

ref:terminal

```
bash-3.2$ ./scripts/index-entries.js
fs.js:653
  return binding.open(pathModule._makeLong(path), stringToFlags(flags), mode);
                 ^

Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/jeremygreer/Ideas/blog/site/public/entries/01/terminal.log'

```

TODO: We need to prefix each command in the terminal.log with a timestamp so
we have some way to tie references here to there.

We need to handle reading the terminal logs more gracefully.

ref:terminal

We've really got to get the linter set up.  I usually do it first thing, but I
don't want to get distracted yet.  Once the problem is big enough, we'll deal
with it.

```
/Users/jeremygreer/Ideas/blog/site/scripts/index-entries.js:32
      terminal: terminal && `${name}/terminal.log`,
                ^

ReferenceError: terminal is not defined
    at getEntryFromDir (/Users/jeremygreer/Ideas/blog/site/scripts/index-entries.js:32:17)

```

...

It's becoming confusing to display the terminal.log.  That could be because
I'm sick, I'm watching TV with the family, or it's just confusing.  Let's
regroup.

Each entry will have a URI associated with it, as should each of its
resources.  Let's ensure each entity we're describing in our JSON has a URI
with it.

ref:git:fb30e4c

ref:git:44d08c8

We've not got uri values for our two entities we're tracking right now, the
entry and the terminal.log.

Let's wrap this entry up and get ready to do something cooler.
