Now that I've done it 14 times, I'm starting to think that it sucks creating
these new entries.  Maybe I'm just tired and too distracted.

So Enzyme isn't happy, saying...

```
          Enzyme Internal Error: Enzyme expects an adapter to be configured, but found none. To
          configure an adapter, you should call `Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() })`
          before using any of Enzyme's top level APIs, where `Adapter` is the adapter
          corresponding to the library currently being tested. For example:

          import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-15';
```

We can look through `package.json` to see our dependency versions, or we can
do it with yarn.

```
yarn list --pattern enzyme
```

ref:terminal

We've added the adapter, but maybe it's just not being set up when Jest runs.
Let's check it by logging in it.

```
// jest.setup.js
import Enzyme from 'enzyme'
import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16'

console.log('Hello!')

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() })
```

Nope, it was not logged.

...

After configuring and googling a little, it turns out there's a magic file you
can use to add a setup step to CRA apps called `src/setupTests.js`.

https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#initializing-test-environment

ref:git:e931bee

We've probably got some junk in node_modules we don't need now, but that's not
uncommon.

Let's get back to testing our ParsedCommentary component.

Here's an image of the setup I use while writing tests.  It's a little
cramped, but it's what works (on a laptop).

ref:git:2283e88

We've got a real test in place.  Now we need to build on it.  Let's see if the
GitRefBlocks come through.

ref:git:455ae12

Good.  Now let's see if we can get images to show.

OK, this is fun, but I'm totally getting sidetracked and recreating my
react-smart-text package.  It probably going to be faster to modify that.  It
may also be an interesting exercise to see how this whole documentation thing
works when switching projects.
