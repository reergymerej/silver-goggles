So we are now reading the files from the directory as we were before, but
we're putting out a new data structure.  The UI understands the structure so
we can see everything.  Let's change the way the files are being read.  It's
nice to do it in two steps like this to minimize problems.  We know the UI can
read it in it's new structure.  As we change the reading part, it will not
work.  Once it's done correctly, everything will work again.

ref: b15be57

Let's try and pull the directories.

ref: 5bb2e5a

We've got it reading from the new structure with one file.  Now let's move the
rest of them.

ref: 673df2e13989f6fc3567ea0e4e789d949b464cfa

They've been moved.  Now let's run the indexing script again and see if
everything shows in the UI as before.

ref: terminal

```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/jeremygreer/Ideas/blog/site/public/entries/04/commentary.txt'
    at Object.fs.openSync (fs.js:653:18)
    at Object.fs.readFileSync (fs.js:554:33)
    at getEntryFromDir (/Users/jeremygreer/Ideas/blog/site/scripts/index-entries.js:16:25)
```

I believe I forgot to rename the text files.  Oops.

ref: 551dc7d

Now everything is named correcly.

ref: c2d1268

Except this file!  I just changed it.  Let's commit everything and push it up
so we can start working on the resources part.
