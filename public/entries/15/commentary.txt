Hello, again!  This happens way more than I like to admit.  One thing lead to
another and now I've found a possible bug in `react-smart-text` while
implementing a new feature.  Now this project smells _very faintly_ like so
many others that make me want to walk away and start a new project.  The
complexity is creeping in and outweighing the coolness.

What is this project supposed to be, anyway?

It was just a blog, right?  Then it was a blog specifically tailored toward
discussing code.  We threw some static resources in and it seems like that
decision started to drive how the rest developed.

I want it to be really easy to create an entry.  Creating filestructres and
whatnot should not be my concern.  That's something the app should do, right?
That could be easily done if we were creating the entry from within the app,
but then we're we'd be working in a browser, which not desirable.

...

Maybe I'm just fried.  I've been sick all weekend and probably doing too much
of this.  It's really not complex, I'm probably just tired of having to
remember the steps to create an entry, log terminal, clean terminal logs, add
various assets, and build it all.  That's _in addition_ to actually trying to
develop and talk about it.  heh

...

Sometimes when you're hitting too many brick walls, it's nice to do something
easy to give yourself a little win.  Let's bandage everything up and then just
add a panel that shows terminal logs when they're available.

This works.  It's not great, but at least it's a forward step.
