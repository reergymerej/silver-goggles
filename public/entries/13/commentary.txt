It seems like we're recreating html.

Let's go something fun like show images.  We could show them inline or stick
with the convention of showing resources in the resource panel on the right.
Eiher way, we'll need to scan the text and identify them like we did for Git
references.


I use lint rules extending AirBnB's at work, so I am not used to some of the
setup.  On thing I've noticed is undefined components being used are not
picked up.

And now they are.  ;)

Aside - I just stored that commit in this entries resources.  Maybe we can do
that going forward.  I'm sure there's a tool out there that can color it and
make it pretty, which is all we were using Github for.
