So we are now reading the files from the directory as we were before, but
we're putting out a new data structure.  The UI understands the structure so
we can see everything.  Let's change the way the files are being read.  It's
nice to do it in two steps like this to minimize problems.  We know the UI can
read it in it's new structure.  As we change the reading part, it will not
work.  Once it's done correctly, everything will work again.
